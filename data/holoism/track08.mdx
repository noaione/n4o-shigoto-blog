        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: That's right! I'm Gensokyo's most powerful fairy, Cirno!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ammazing! To think I would one day get to meet the famous Cirno on the roadside!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You never know what to expect when you're a captain!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Is this fairy really that popular in your world?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Cirno's a super popular character! Even kids know about her! Idiot! Idiot!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: Idiot? Are you calling me an Idiot?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ah, no, not at all. I was singing!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: <em>♫ A sparkling diamonds! ♫</em></p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: She said I was sparkling! Like an Idol!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Indeed. Well I'm glad it was you we bumped into.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Hey, fairy. This human is a guest of Scarlet Devil Mansion.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: She says she wants to do some sightseeeing.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: You mean she wants to have fun around here? The Misty Lake?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Yes, and to be her guide, a local like you would be the best choice, right?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: Of course! I'm the best!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh? What about you, Patche? You're not coming?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You're neglecting me? Is this neglect play?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: I'll come back later.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: So, go and play like a good girl.</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: Tada! This is Misty Lake's hottest spot!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: This is... the snow hut where I live!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Snow huts are nice and all, but is there somewhere to rest like a bench, or...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: A bench?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: What's up with you? Are you tired? If you want to sit, then just sit!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: But the ground here hasn't been leveled or anything. It's just rough terrain.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: It's hard just getting about. Talk about disappointing tourist spots...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: Hey! Are you dissatisfied in some way with my perfect tourist ambassadorship?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Dissatisfied? Well... There's also this mist which makes it hard to see anything.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: It's the Misty Lake. What were you expecting?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: Are you an idiot? An idiot?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: To be called an idiot by Cirno of all people...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I think I'll take a look around to cheer up.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: Hehe! It's too early to get tired!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: Our next hot spot is that crag you can see over there! You see...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Yes?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: Before, there was a huge frog there!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Oh... Oh... How rural.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: He's here today too! Look, over there!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: This is kinda like having to follow your little cousin around as he shows you his favorite spots near his house.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: Huh? What? I don't get it.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: Alright! Next is this way!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: She really doesn't get it...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: Huh? Look! The frail one is back!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ah! Patche! I'm so glad you're back!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Sorry for the delay. Making progress with your sightseeeing?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: Of course!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Um... Somewhat.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Well. I have a tourist spot waiting in reserve for any tourists.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: A tourist spot... in reserve?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: I spoke to Remi. She's waiting for you at the mansion.</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: I've been waiting for you, Houshou Marine, Captain of the Houshou Pirates.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: I am the mistress of the mansion, Remilia Scarlet.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Oh! Mistress Remilia!? It really is Mistress Remilia! How wonderful!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I'm really so very glad that I could meet...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: I'm Gensokyo's Tourism Ambassador, Cirno!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: I don't remember inviting you. Why are you here?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: I was showing her around first! She's my prey!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: She's not a prey. She's a guest of Scarlet Devil Mansion. Got that?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: If we're guests, then at least bring us some tea. I'm thirsty!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: Do I look like a maid to you?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Um... Well, no reason to get so heated.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: Ahh... Anyway I heard your story from Patche.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: To speak painly, you are of deep interest of me.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Okay! Uh... Deep interest? You mean...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Mistress Remilia, are you the type who watches my streams?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: Streams? Hmm... Some kind of culture from the outside world?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Of course... There's no YouTube in Gensokyo...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Well, to explain streaming...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: Yes, it's interesting... Despite you living out there, you know about the people and goings-on of Gensokyo to this extent.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Yes, that's right! I mean, I love Touhou!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I even streamed Embodiment of Scarlet Devil!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I beat Flan, too!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: Huh? Flan...?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ah, sorry! I'm talking about a game. I prefer the original games.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: What is she talking about? I don't get it at all.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I was just talking about how I know so much about Gensokyo.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: As far as Embodiment— or rather, the mansion is concerned, I like Sakuya and Flan, and I like Futo from "Ten Desires", and I've played all the games.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I know everything there is to know about Touhou!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: Yes, you are well informed about Flan and things outside of the mansion.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: Even in Gensokyo, the number of humans who know that much about us is rather limited.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ah... I'm acting like an online stalker again...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Sorry. I'm really not a weirdo or anything.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: Yes, just as I thought. This is deeply unsettling.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh? N-no... Really, I'm not creepy at all...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Dear me. And I was looking forward to hearing your thoughts, Remi.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: There aren't many research specimens like this one. Please don't break it.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: Heh, who do you think you're talking to?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: C-Can it be, that you did this to capture me...!?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Cirno, please speak up for me!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: Y-Y-You were a creep all this time!?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Idiot! I just said I wasn't!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-cirno">Cirno</b>: What are you going to do, Remilia? Capture her?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You're not going to help me!? Why did you even come?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: Good idea. A creep with that kind of knowledge can't be allowed to roam free near the mansion.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Now, now. No violence, okay?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Heeey! Ah, well... I need to go back home to stream, so it's about time I set sail...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: Your departure is cancelled.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: I won't feel calm until you've spilled your guts on everything you know.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I'm done for! Help me!</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: Wh-What!? That's... Marisa!?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Aha! Marisa! Hey! Oof!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Sorry to barge in on your scheming! I'm borrowing this human for a bit.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-remilia">Remilia</b>: This human thief—! Wait!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: I'm glad I anticipated this eventuality and interrupted. Alright! We're escaping!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Marisa! I should've known I could only rely on the protagonist team.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: <b>-</b> Next time, I'll be sure to play as you, too!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: <b>-</b> Be quiet before you bite your tongue!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: I'm going to zip you to the shrine.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh? The shrine?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Things are bad. For you, and for Reimu.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Reimu?</p>
