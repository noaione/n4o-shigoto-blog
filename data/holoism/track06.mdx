        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: So this is Gensokyo's Human Village!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: This place shows up all the time in doujinshi. It's pretty bustling!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: How does the Human Village here compare to your world?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: A lot of people live in my world.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Science and technology are pretty advanced, too.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: But the architecture here is so retro. It's totally my thing.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Well, I'm glad you like it...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Okay, here we are.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Gensokyo... Cafe?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh? We were headed here? Are we here to have tea?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: ... Not exactly. Ah good, she's here!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Hey!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: That lady... Can it be!?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Alice Margatroid!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: Hmm? Me?</p>

        <br />
        
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Yeah, I didn't know what I was gonna do for a while there, but if Alice is here, then I can relax.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: Really? I'm so glad.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: Well, I certainly never expected to pick up a burden like this at afternoon tea time.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Please don't call me a burden.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: But you really helped me out by picking me up.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Are you always at that cafe? So you're a city girl, really?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: That kind of information made it through to your world?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Of course, we know it all!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I got into Touhou with Perfect Cherry Blossom...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: What... are you talking about?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ah, so the titles mean nothing to you...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Um... Never mind, I just love everyone from Gensokyo!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: So no worries on that front. Yup.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: Oh, really? Well, okay...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: Okay, we're here.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh? This is...</p>
        
        <br />
       
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: Marisa? I'm coming in.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Alright!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Welcome! Oh, it's you, Alice. Well, take your time and...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Oh. How unexpected.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: Patchouli? I could say the same for you.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: Meeting in a dusty place like this...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: I can't deny it.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: I only come here when I have...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Honestly, squabbling right after meeting. Are you guys friends or not?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>, <b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Huh? Friends?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: By the way, who is that girl behind you? A human?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: She sure is dressed weird.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Can I have this?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Hey, hey. I don't know who you are, but only thieves carry off other people's stuff without permission.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>, <b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: She's one to talk.</p>

        <br />

        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ahoy! Hololive 3rd Generation, Captain of the Houshou Pirates, Houshou Marine here!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: Or, to get to the point, it seems she's kind of a weird castaway.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Huh, that's interesting!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: So you took charge of her from Udonge, and brought her here?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: This kind of special problem is sort of your territory, right?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Hmm. There's certainly truth to that.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: When I first came to, I was in a bamboo forest, and I was so worried at first, but Udonge and Alice have been so kind, and on top of that I got to meet the three witches, and I just feel so moved. I'm so grateful.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Plus we have similar names. It's so nice to meet you.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Hmm... Being known before I even introduce myself makes mee feel a little embarrassed.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Well whatever. Nice to meet you!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I'm so glad you're friendly!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Say, how much do you know about Gensokyo?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: How much? Hmm...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Well, rather than Gensokyo, if we're talking about Touhou...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Let's see... The songs, the characters, the bullet hell games, the spell cards...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: There's just so much!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Songs? What's that about?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Bullet hell games and spell cards... Oh-ho...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: By characters, do you mean personalities?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: Everyone around mee is a pain in the ass.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: It's not personality thing, but... Do you know this?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Despite Alice's appearance, she often oversleeps...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: Could you not bring that up? I already apologized...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Such important business, and you show up 2 hours late...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: Lalala~! I can't hear you~!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: <span className="italic">(Hmm. Those two aren't thinking it through, but this is interesting. But more than that...)</span></p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: By the way. What are you planning to do now?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: If you came from outside, you have no family here.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Oh, you're right! I got so excited to meet you all, but... is there a way for me to return to my own world?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: That's the main issue, isn't it.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: For this kind of thing... Reimu or Yukari would be the best people to ask.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: For the moment, shall we let Reimu take care of it? It shouldn't be dangerous.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Reimu!? I get to meet Reimu!? Reimu's really here?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Well, she's here in this world.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: But the shrine would be far to go on foot, so how about I go get her?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Until then. Hmm... Where should we...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: We could use my house. But even if she's protected by magic, I would feel awkward leaving her so long in a magical forest.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: Hmm...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: In that case, I'll take her.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: I'll get permission.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>, <b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Huh?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You mean... Scarlet Devil Mansion!?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Yes. You know it, right?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: O-o-o-of course! I met you so many times on the extra stage of Scarlet Devil Mansion! That bit where...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: Is this okay? She won't get nabbed and eaten?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: <b>-</b> That's possible...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: <b>-</b> I'm scared! I don't want to lose a life!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: We wouldn't do anything so conspicuous.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Don't treat us like a low-level youkai.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: I suppose you're right. Then, I guess we can leave it to you?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Of course.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Well then, my dear. How about we have a nice long chat back at my place?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh!? "My dear"!?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: For a moment, Patchouli became my wife...</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: Are you okay?</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I don't know!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Then everything's sorted!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: I'll go to the shrine. Alice will go... somewhere.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: PatchouMari will go sightseeing.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Sightseeing! Yes! I really want to do some Gensokyo sightseeing!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: She seems to be enjoying herself.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-alice">Alice</b>: Well, I won't stop her if she's happy.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Marine, you'll be shocked when you see the real thing.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: It looks so out of place. It's one of Gensokyo's disappointing tourist spots!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I wanna see it more and more! I can't wait!</p>
        <p><b className="sp-patchouli">Patchouli</b>: What a way to speak about someone's home.</p>
        <p><b className="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Okay! If that's settled, time to set sail for some Gensokyo sightseeing!</p>
