        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Thank you, thank you.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: That was IOSYS' Touhou Arrangement, Captain...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Um.. Captain Marine's Assanchor.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Yeah, so today I thought I'd sing a lot of Touhou stuff so I had a lot prepared...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ah, sorry guys. Wait a sec.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Today it seems like the noise from outside is kinda loud.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Wait right there. I'm going to mute the mic for a second.</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: This is weird. Suddenly today so many trucks are passing. The sounds' going to be picked up. What to do...</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I'm back! Sorry for the wait.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: For some reason, a lot of trucks are passing outside today.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Well, I'm probably not going to get hit by one and get reborn into another world, like a light novel.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Okay, right. So the next song is... I guess I'll sing this...</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Oh yeah.. That's right.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: At today's song event I sang Assanchor, then when I looked outside, suddenly a truck crashed into my place!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: There was a huge impact, and when I woke up, I was.. here.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Waaah! They're just leaves...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I can't stand it here. It's scary...</p>
        <p><b>???</b>: Hehehe... You don't have to act so scared.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ahh!</p>

        <p className="italic">~ Can she escape this bamboo forest? ~</p>

        <br />

        <p><b>???</b>: It's only natural for a human to get lost here.</p>
        <p><b>???</b>: This is the Bamboo Forest of the Lost, after all.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Bamboo Forest of the Lost? Here?</p>
        <p><b>???</b>: It's for times like this that we are here.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Waaah!</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: What the...? A bunny-eared... cosplay girl?</p>
        <p><b>???</b>: I'm so glad you're fun to startle.</p>
        <p><b>???</b>: I was in a bad mood, and was hoping a lost human might show up to lift my spirits.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh? What the hell are you? A deviant?</p>
        <p><b>???</b>: I'm not a rabbit of much renown, but I'm in charge of these parts.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: A bunny-eared cosplay girl in Bamboo Forest of the Lost...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Wha- wha- what's going on here?</p>
        <p><b>???</b>: Hmm... You're kind of a yound girl, so if I get you to the village, maybe I can make some money.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: What? Don't give me that cute face while you're thinking nasty thoughts!</p>
        <p><b>???</b>: This kind of prank isn't a big deal.</p>
        <p><b>???</b>: Besides, I'll take you out of the forest.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: - I'm going to get tricked by a cosplayer!</p>
        <p><b>???</b>: - Not so loud! Keep your voice down!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: - Help me! Anyone, please help me!</p>
        <p><b>????</b>: Really. I did warn you.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Who's that? A passerby?</p>
        <p><b>???</b>: Her again?</p>
        <p><b>????</b>: Are you okay? You've not been tricked or teased, have you?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I'm alright. Thank you so much!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Thanks to you, I'm sav-... Those ears!</p>
        <p><b>????</b>: Yes? These ears? It's okay.</p>
        <p><b>????</b>: I came here to catch this rabbit.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: That blazer... That long hair...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Udonge and Inaba Tewi!</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>, <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Reborn in another world?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: You?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: That's the only explanation...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Udonge and Tewi, the stage 5 bosses from "Imperishable Night".</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: What does "reborn in another world" mean?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You don't even know what it means!?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: In other words, from my world, I...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Um... got transported to Gensokyo? Well, it's not like I understand it
        either.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Ah. Happens all the time.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: No, it doesn't! Not in my world, anyway!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: No... Actually, things drift into Gensokyo from other worlds all the time.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: For real?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Still, it's not that common for humans to show up.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: You must've been worried.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: As long as I'm here, you're safe.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Thank you!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You're not just there for fan service! I like you for you!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Hold on. I found her first. Isn't this girl mine to look after?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Enough of that. Don't act like some feral youkai.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Don't order me around!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: We're enemies, after all.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh? Enemies?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Are you still going on about that? Honestly...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I thought the two of you were kind of a double-act, but...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You don't get along?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: - I don't know about that, but...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: - She's the worst!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Could you not both speak at once?</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: So, to summarise...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: I received a lot of good carrots, so I thought I'd make her something
        nice.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: So you made baked sweats with carrot in them.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Can you believe her?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Putting precious carrots in something like that.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: I heard they're popular with the humans in the village, and so I made
        some for her.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: And this is her attitude?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You mean like carrot cake? That's normal.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Give me a break. I was so hungry I thought I'd starve, and she puts carrots,
        precious carrots, into cakes.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: It's carrot desecration!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: So when I asked about you not getting along, <em>that</em> was the reason?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: - What's that about? How cute!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: - How long do you thing we've been rabbits?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: You don't have to get so mad about it. Complaining from dawn...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Finally storming out of Eientei...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Hahahaha! How childish!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Don't call me childish! I'm older than you!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: But I apologized, didn't I?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: And I said I wouldn't make them anymore...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: I was just so hurt, and so hungry. Starving...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Even so, Udonge gave an honest apology.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: "Honestly"... Oh yeah! The start of "Happy Rabbits"!</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: In the world I came from there's a song about your friendship, even
        through your quarrels and misbehavior.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>, <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Friends? Us?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Don't give me that look.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: It's a lovely duet, you know. Though one vocalist's an old guy.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Which one's the old man?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh? Which one was it...?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: I have no idea...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Judging by the lyrics...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: It's probably you.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Me!?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: They know you so well.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: But anyway...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You're such a cute pair, so instead of fighting, let's see you get
        along.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: It'll help move things along.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Hey, why don't you say something?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Hmph, this is bumming me out.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: My anger's gone and vanished.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: That's perfect. Good girl!</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Enough. I'll overlook today, so hurry along back home.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Don't waste this good fortune.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh? You're leaving? Wait!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: That's just like her.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Now, at at time like this...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh? What is it?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Ah, there's one. Here!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: This is... a four-leafed clover!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: No, five, six, even more? Huh?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Her ability is to confer good luck to humans.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: If you have this, good things will happen to you.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: First off, I'll take you to safety of the Human Village.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ah, I'm so glad. Thank you! I'm counting on you!</p>
