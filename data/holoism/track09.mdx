        <p>魔理沙に連れられ、博麗神社に向かうマリン。そこには幻想郷の異常を察知した紫と幽々子がいた。</p>
        <p>紫によれば、マリンの転移は超えてはならない境界を超える、ごくイレギュラーなもので、</p>
        <p>幻想郷にとって非常に危険なものだという。</p>
        <br />
        <p>事態の正常化のため、紫が捻りだした方策は「来た時と同じ状況を作り、再現させる」こと。</p>
        <p>すなわち、幻想郷で「マリンが配信をしていたらトラックにはねられた」という状況を作ることだった。</p>

            Taken to Hakurei Shrine by Marisa, Marisa encounters Yuyuko, who has sensed a disturbance in
            Gensokyo.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to Yukari, Marine's transportation to Gensokyo involved the crossing of boundaries that
            should never be crossed - a highly irregular occurence.
        </p>
        <p>It seems this spells grave danger for Gensokyo.</p>
        <br />
        <p>To put things right, Yukari's plan it replicate the circumstances of Marine's transportation.</p>
        <p>In other words, she wants Marine to get hit by a truck while live streaming in Gensokyo.</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Nice to meet you, Houshou Marine.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: I wonder how you're finding Gensokyo.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ahh! Mistress Yukari! Mistress Yukari!!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Um, are you okay?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Yes! Uh, sorry! Mistress Yukari is just so beautiful...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: Hmm... It seems you're popular.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Let's move on.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: As you know, I'm Yakumo Yukari. I manage the boundaries of Gensokyo.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Through Marisa, I've heard about what has befallen you.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Such misfortune... I offer my sympathies.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ah, no, really— I mean, I...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Your desire now is, perhaps, to find a way back to your world, am I right?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Yes, it is! I...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Yes?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: The thing is, now it's night, and dark outside.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I suddenly think about live streaming.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Gensokyo does seems like fun, if I don't get back, I think everyone back home will be worried.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: Indeed.</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: To skip to the conclusion, A method of returning you to your world is beyond me.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh!?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: From what I've heard from Marisa, what you call your own world is different to what we in Gensokyo often refer to as the "Outside World".</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: That is my guess, at any rate.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Um... What does that mean?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: This assumption is based on your knowledge of Gensokyo.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: People from the Outside World are unable to look into Gensokyo as you are.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Castaways and invaders from outside are not that uncommon in Gensokyo.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: But your case... To be frank, this matter involves interfering with borders that shouldn't be messed with.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Uh... uhh...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: I don't even know the cause.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: One possibility is that your longing for Gensokyo was so extreme, your will somehow affect reality.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Of course, that kind of thing is usually impossible.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Wh-What!?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You mean I can't go home!?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: No! Gensokyo is nice and all, but this is awful!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: Calm down, Marine.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: In any case, it's necessary for Gensokyo too, that we try to return you to your own world.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: That's right. The truth is, strange things are happening noww in Gensokyo.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Strange things? You mean like an accident?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Since you arrived in Gensokyo this morning, all sign of Reimu disappeared from Gensokyo.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: It's almost as if you swapped places...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: The loss of the shrine maiden will have a major impact on Gensokyo's survival.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: This incident requires urgent attention.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: E-Exactly! Huh? You mean...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: As far as we know, you are the only one who has a potential causal relationship to this incident.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: I would like to explain in detail just what you were doing in your own world.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Um... How do you mean?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: This is my thinking: If we can replicate the circumstances that led you here, you can return to your own world, and that which Gensokyo has lost, will be returned here.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Which means...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: We want you to get hit by a truck while streaming from your room.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh!?</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: Does this look okay for your room, Marine?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: I tried to make it as close to your description as possible, but...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Wait wait wait...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: This isn't so much a room as it is half a room, like a movie set.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: The computer is just an empty box that's the same size.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: It was a rush job, sorry.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: And there's not much furniture.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: That's not my point! Listen to me!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Marine, please look this way and try speaking.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ehh... Ah~ Ah~</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: What is this? My voice is echoing. Is this a mic?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: This is a spell that delivers your voice to every corner of Gensokyo.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: What are you doing!? You're really going to make me stream here?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: I want to closely recreate the circumstances.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: I'm counting on you.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Don't act like you know everything!</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Hey, Marine! Sorry for the wait! I've got the truck ready!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: For goodness sake...! This is the thing I was least waiting for.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: How is this the only real thing here?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: This is tonight's top prize.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: We stole one from the Outside World.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Why did you do that!?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Uh, how do you plan to drive it!?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: The truck will move through my magic.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: After all, the engine is...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You're going to say "the engine is all about firepower", right?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Uh... Well...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Don't look like I stole your thunder! At least finish saying it!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: Phew, Marine. With this, preparations are complete.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: You are now free to stream.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: We can't do it precisely, but it looks like we can start at about the same time.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: For now... Let's roll the dice on this chance.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Wait a second!!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Um... You see...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: It's true that I said I was streaming at home, when a truck suddenly crashed into me, and when I woke up I was in Gensokyo. But...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: But if we re-enact that, have me stream from my room, then hit me with a truck will I really be able to get back to my own world!?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Will Reimu really come back!?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Are you taking this seriously!?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: It's a ridiculous set-up, I'll grant you.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: So you agree!?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Unfortunately, there's not a lot we can try.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: The truth behind this incident is rather unclear.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ugh... I'm being pressured by that seductive androgynous voice.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: We must bet on your luck and on destiny.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ah...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Well?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: O-Okay... I'll do my best.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: Alright, it's about time to start. Please stand back. Alright.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: One last thing... I don't really want to think about it, but if this fails, what happens?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Then, of course, it would be Yuyuko's turn.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: I'll take care of you once you're dead, okay?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: I'll put in a good word for you on the other side.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: No! This is too far removed from common sense! This is crazy!</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Come now, there's no need to cry.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: In your world, your pirates are waiting for you, right?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: This is a place where the forgotten wash up.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: A popular girl like you with fans waiting for you can't stay here in Gensokyo for long.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Marisa...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Besides, if you're lucky, you can come back some time!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: So for now, it's time to go home, right?</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You're right, okay...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Yes. Thank you.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: If we succeed, Reimu might come back, too.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: The future of Gensokyo depends on this live stream.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: My beloved world of Touhou!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Got it! Let's do this!</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: It's time.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Right. Please begin.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ah, okay.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Nothing else for it...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Alright... Time to put it all on the line.</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: <em>Testing... Can you hear me? Ahoy!</em></p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: <em>This is Houshou Marine of the Houshou Pirates!</em></p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: <em>Today, if you can believe it, I'm broadcasting from here in Gensokyo.</em></p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: <em>Unfortunately, in a bit, I have to get hit by a truck.</em></p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: <em>It's been crazy.</em></p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: <em>Well... Yeah, today, seriously so much crazy stuff's happened.</em></p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: <em>Well, even by saying I came to Gensokyo some people will think I'm lying.</em></p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: <em>But it's true! It's for real!</em></p>
        <p><b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: <em>I got to meet my favorite Touhou characters for real...</em></p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Hahaha! She sounds like she's enjoying chatting.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: A world where people can celebrate the things they love...</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yuyuko">Yuyuko</b>: It might be that girl comes from such a world as that.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: For Gensokyo to open a gateway for her, it must be a good place.</p>
        <p><b class="sp-yukari">Yukari</b>: Well then. Marisa! Now's the time!</p>

        <br />

        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: The Hakkero engine is in good shape!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Alright! Here I go!</p>
        <p><b class="sp-marisa">Marisa</b>: Master Truck!</p>
