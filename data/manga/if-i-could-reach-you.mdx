synopsis: |
    In this heartwrenching new yuri manga, a teenage girl comes to terms with
    her own sexuality through her crush on her brother’s wife. Hopelessly in love,
    high schooler Uta must navigate living with her brother and Kaoru, her crush...
    and sister-in-law. Desperate to get over her unrequited feelings, Uta pulls away,
    but when the cracks in her brother’s marriage begin to show, Kaoru begins to
    confide in her new teenage sister, which just makes matters worse!
