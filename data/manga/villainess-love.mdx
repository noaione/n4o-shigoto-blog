synopsis: |
    **A story of reincarnated gamer pursuing her villainous lady love at a fantasy girls’ academy!**

    When corporate worker Rei Ohashi finds herself reborn as the protagonist of her favorite dating sim,
    it’s the perfect opportunity to do what she’s always wanted—seduce the villainess!
    In her previous life, Rei had no interest in the princes the game had to offer.
    She only had eyes for Claire François, her nemesis. Now, armed with her extensive knowledge of the game,
    and her undying love for Claire, will Rei finally be able to win over the woman of her dreams?
