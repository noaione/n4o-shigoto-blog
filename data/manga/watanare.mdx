synopsis: |
    **A high school yuri comedy about fake dating, real dating, competitive dating–and one very overwhelmed girl who’s accidentally doing all three at once?!**

    Renako Amaori is leaving her awkward and lonely junior high school life behind, determined to
    become a normal girl with normal friends in high school. Glamorous, confident Mai Ouzuka is
    Renako’s total opposite: wealthy, outgoing, and a literal fashion model. Against the odds, the
    two girls form an immediate connection. Renako thinks she may have found the best friend of her
    dreams… until Mai’s romantic confession sends her into a tailspin. Renako wants to prove to Mai
    that being BFFs is better than being girlfriends, but Mai is dead set on convincing Renako that
    they’re destined to be lovers. Let the love games begin!
