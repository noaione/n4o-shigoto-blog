synopsis: |
    **I’d love to be friends!**

    Two high school classmates, Sakura Miyazen and Sota Matsubayashi, are polar opposites: Miyazen is a
    prim and proper young lady, while Matsubayashi is a brusque former troublemaker. They’re secretly dying
    to talk to each other, but their backgrounds are so different, they can’t seem to strike up a
    conversation! And why does a simple greeting make the both of them turn red?!
