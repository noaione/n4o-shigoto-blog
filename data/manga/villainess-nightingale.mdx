synopsis: |
    **"If dragging my name through the mud is what it takes to save a life, then that's what I'll do!"**

    After an unfortunate accident, a lonely woman in her thirties finds herself reincarnated as
    Leysritt Von Lotus, a beautiful, young noble lady. Instead of worrying about boring things
    like meetings, her biggest problems now include which snacks she wants served with her tea.
    But something feels off... This world looks an awful lot like the ones in the stories she liked
    to read in her past life! What if she's not the protagonist, but actually the villainess?!
    Watch as Leysritt navigates her brand new life, using her education as a nurse to overcome
    challenges and capture the hearts of those around her!
