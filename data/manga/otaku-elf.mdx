synopsis: |
    **A lighthearted manga series about a quirky elf from another world who’s fascinated by video games–and the local girls who have to deal with her.**

    Koganei Koito works as the teenage shrine maiden at the Takamimi Shrine,
    catering to the whims of its resident: a centuries-old elf who loves video games
    as much as she hates going outside! Line up your offerings for the otaku elf—some energy drinks,
    chips and video games will do nicely—and watch her new friends scramble to keep up!
