synopsis: |
    **In this charming tale, a woman gets transported to a fantasy world and pursues her own quest: opening a book café!**

    Tsukina is a single, thirty-something office worker whose favorite thing is
    curling up with a good book. When a god tells her that she must go to another
    world to become its magical savior, Tsukina isn’t interested. She has zero desire
    to go on some grand hero’s journey. So when she arrives in this strange new land,
    she decides to use her magical powers to create a cozy little book café instead.
    Her first customer is a handsome soldier who loves reading almost as much as she does.
    But when a fellow “savior” starts causing trouble, Tsukina might have to play the hero after all!
