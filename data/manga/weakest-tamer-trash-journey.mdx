synopsis: |
    **A heartwarming fantasy isekai tale about a girl who embarks on a journey with her new friend–a humble slime.**

    When Ivy learns she’s “starless,” she knows her life is over. Without stars, she can’t use
    her Tamer skill to subdue even the smallest of animals. So she flees into the forest,
    where she befriends a lowly slime named Sora—the one creature she can tame.
    Together, this unlikely pair begins salvaging other people’s rubbish in an attempt to turn their lives around!
