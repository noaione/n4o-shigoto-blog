synopsis: |
    **In this fantasy isekai story, a salaryman sent to another world chooses a farming life over adventure–and ends up with a mermaid wife!**

    A corporate drone is summoned to another world and granted a powerful skill, “Supreme Wielder,”
    which is invisible to those who summoned him. They’re dismayed to see he’s useless to them, so he
    asks only for a little plot of land to work for himself. His skill allows him to use any tool to
    its greatest abilities, including fishing poles, cooking utensils, and construction tools. When he
    fishes up a mermaid who wants him for her bridegroom, charms a young dragon with his cooking,
    and excites an undead king with his rare skill, how long can his quiet country life last?!
