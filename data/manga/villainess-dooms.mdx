synopsis: |
    At the age of eight, Katarina, a girl of noble birth in another world,
    has an accident that unlocks her memories–of playing an otome game that’s
    exactly like the life she’s living now. There’s one problem: she realizes that she’s
    playing the role of the villainess, and only bad endings await her!
    What will it take for her to “break the game” and live a happy life?
