synopsis: |
    **A charming isekai comedy about an unremarkable merchant summoned to another world to be a hero…or maybe just hang out.**

    Banaza, a young merchant, is summoned to an unfamiliar world to become a legendary hero!
    But his unimpressive stats disqualify him, and Banaza isn’t sent home, but exiled to the
    edge of a monster-filled forest. Fortune takes a turn when his first battle bumps him to
    Level 2–and his previously NPC-grade stats leap to infinity! Banaza is determined to live
    a normal life despite his god-level power, but his world is turned upside down yet again
    when he meets Fenrys–a fair maiden who happens to be a fiendish demon.
    Kick back and chill with Banaza’s tale of cheating his way to an easygoing existence in a thrilling fantasy world!
