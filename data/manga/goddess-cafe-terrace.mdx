synopsis: |
    When Hayato's grandmother passed, he planned to sell her rundown café on the shore—not
    realizing that it was also home to five young women who call themselves her family?!
    Their desperation to keep the café open convinces Hayato to give it a shot...but even
    their best intentions might not be enough to make it work! And can he even work with
    these five unruly women? No matter what, he's got his work cut out for him!
