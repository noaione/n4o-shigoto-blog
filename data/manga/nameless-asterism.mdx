    **A charming series of romance and friendship where love is as boundless as space!**

    Tsukasa, Nadeshiko, and Mikage have been inseparable since they began junior high,
    but Tsukasa has a secret she’s been keeping from her best friends–she actually has a
    big crush on Nadeshiko! Not wanting to risk their friendship, she planned to keep it
    a secret forever, but when Tsukasa learns that Nadeshiko has a crush on Mikage,
    her desire to support her friends now conflicts with her own feelings.
