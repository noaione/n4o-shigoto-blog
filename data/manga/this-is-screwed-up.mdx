synopsis: |
    **In this isekai tale, a male scientist from Earth is reborn as an orphan girl in a world of swords and sorcery.**

    Ren, a young orphan girl, has been sold off to a merchant with sinister plans for her.
    Suddenly, memories of her past life on a world called Earth come flooding back, and Ren
    remembers that she used to be a research scientist–and a grown man! As Ren escapes into
    the Dark Forest, magical powers awaken within her. In order to survive the harsh realities
    of this world, she must use her rekindled knowledge of Earth’s science as well as her newfound
    powers! Will her magical cheat powers and past-life knowledge be enough to keep her freedom,
    or is she doomed to a life of servitude?
