synopsis: |
    In the Forest of Scraps, a place where all manner of things are discarded,
    an old dragon sleeps away his final days—that is, until an abandoned child suddenly appears before him.
    The tiny human is Eve, and despite being only five years of age, she has somehow endured
    the many dangers that surround them. In an act of pity, the dragon decides to raise her as his own...
    but his time is still running out. After five years together, he takes his last breath,
    leaving his precious daughter on her own. Little does the dragon know,
    Eve is capable of more than he realizes, and their reunion may be sooner than he thinks...
    Hoping to improve Eve’s control over her magical abilities before his resurrected body gives out,
    the skull dragon sets out on an adventure with his reckless human daughter—but
    who knows what kind of trouble awaits them?
