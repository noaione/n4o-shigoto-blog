synopsis: |
    Princess Anisphia may not be able to use magic, but she didn’t let that stop her from
    developing “magicology,” a unique theory based on memories from her past life. While
    testing out her new flying broom, she happens across Euphyllia, a magical genius, having
    her engagement unjustly and publicly broken off. Seeing the tears in Euphyllia’s eyes,
    Anisphia takes the obvious course of action—kidnapping the girl for herself!
