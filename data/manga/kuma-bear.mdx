synopsis: |
    **A bouncy series about a girl transported to a fantasy world like her favorite video game with her magical bearsuit equipped!**

    Fifteen-year-old video game addict Yuna is set for life: she funds her shut-in lifestyle
    by playing the stock market and then spends every other free moment playing her favourite
    virtual reality MMO. After a game update, Yuna receives a way-too-cute bear outfit that’s
    super overpowered! There’s no way Yuna would ever wear something that embarrassing,
    but after being sucked into a fantasy world, she might not have a choice!
