synopsis: |
    **These adorable animals may walk like us and talk like us, but can they learn to live like us?**

    Across the planet, animals are turning into humans! Well, mostly human anyway.
    These animal-featured new individuals must learn how to live in their new bodies and amongst one other.
    It’s for this reason some are sent to Animalium—an all-girls school specifically for this new species—and
    it’s there these girls will learn all they need to know about themselves and each other!
