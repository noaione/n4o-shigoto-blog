synopsis: |
    When the civilizations of yesteryear fade from memory and become fanciful fantasy,
    the only evidence of their existence...are books. Ash, a young boy living in a remote farming village,
    holds a secret—he possesses memories of a distant and more bountiful past life.
    Days of toiling in the fields have given rise to a burning desire: to bring more enjoyment
    to the everyday doldrum of his dreary present day! And while books may be the answer,
    Ash...can’t actually read! But where there is a will, there is a way.
    Join Ash as he battles illiteracy and sets his sights on a better life!
