synopsis: |
    **This over-the-top comedy about delicate young ladies indulging in hardcore gaming!**

    Kuromi Girls’ Academy is a refined, elegant school that expects the very best in deportment from
    its young ladies. Aya got into this peerless rich-girls’ institution on a scholarship, and hopes
    to grow as lovely as her fellow student and idol Shirayui. But Shirayui hides a terrible secret:
    she’s a trash-talking, combo-chaining, newbie-stomping, ruthless hardcore gamer! Could a mutual
    indulgence in no-holds-barred video game combat grow into a deeper rapport between these two girls?
