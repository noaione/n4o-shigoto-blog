synopsis: |
    As players of Monster Hunter and Dungeons & Dragons know, the slime is not exactly the king of the fantasy monsters.
    So when a 37-year-old Tokyo salaryman dies and wakes up in a world of dragons and magic,
    he’s a little disappointed to find he’s become a blind, boneless slime monster.

    Mikami’s middle age hasn’t gone as he planned: He never found a girlfriend,
    he got stuck in a dead-end job, and he was abruptly stabbed to death in the street at 37.
    So when he wakes up in a new world straight out of a fantasy RPG, he’s disappointed but not
    exactly surprised to find that he’s not a knight or a wizard but a blind slime demon.
    But there are chances for even a slime to become a hero...
