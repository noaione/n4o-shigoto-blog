synopsis: |
    **A thrilling fantasy romance between a hero and a priestess–that starts with the hero’s death!**

    In the final battle with the Demon King, Shibuki performs the ultimate sacrifice,
    dying to protect his childhood love. His only regret is not confessing before his demise.
    Luckily for him, it seems God has other plans for this Hero and Saint duo.
    Shibuki rises from the dead during his own funeral! Shibuki’s new chance at life isn’t all it appears,
    for it’s no “life” at all. The Demon King laid one last curse on him during their duel,
    and now Shibuki is undead! To be freed from the grievous curse of undeath,
    he and his team must hunt down and defeat the Demon Lord once and for all! Again!
