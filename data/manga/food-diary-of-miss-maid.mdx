synopsis: |
    What's a maid to do when she finds herself suddenly stuck in Japan for a year?
    Eat, of course! Follow maid-in-training Suzume Tachibana as she tries all sorts
    of Japanese food, from sweets like taiyaki and melon bread to savory snacks like
    takoyaki and onigiri! Be warned, though—while Suzume sates her appetite through
    delicious treat after delicious treat, she might just end up whetting yours!
