synopsis: |
    A salaryman suffers a heart attack and is reborn in another world as Ars Louvent,
    the child of an aristocratic house. Though lacking in physical strength, Ars has
    a unique "appraisal" skill that lets him see other people's stats and latent abilities.
    He puts this skill to the test by discovering a downtrodden young man with fearsome
    blade skills and a street urchin with a knack for magic. Has Ars found the diamonds
    in the rough that will help him secure his family's fortunes?
