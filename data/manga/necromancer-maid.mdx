synopsis: |
    **"This girl cleans using necromancy!"**

    A young girl—Chloe La Forêt—is alone and unconscious in the Corpse Forest. Well,
    it's too bad. At least the monsters will finish her off within a few days.

    Except this girl gets rescued in the nick of time. And the man who finds her? He's her new boss,
    Alchemist Kurakazu Rintarou. Chloe has a knack for cleaning and thus becomes his housekeeper.
    But she quickly reveals another hidden talent of hers—necromancy!
    Watch as this story of science and fiction unfold under one roof.
