synopsis: |
    Princess Leticiel is the most powerful sorceress of her remote kingdom, and adored by everyone.
    But as her land is ravaged by an endless war, she loses everything. Her people, her family,
    her loved ones, and eventually, her own life.

    Until she opens her eyes and awakens in a place she’s never seen before!

    A thousand years have passed, and she finds herself reincarnated in a different time in the body
    of a different person; the lazy and incompetent Dorossel. Dismissed and apparently despised by her
    family and even her fiancé, she struggles to understand this new world and the events that have
    transpired since her death.

    There’s a lot to be mad about, but first on the list: how on earth did future magic turn out so lame?
