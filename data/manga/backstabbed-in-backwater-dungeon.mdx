synopsis: |
    **In this fantasy tale, a weak human adventurer is determined to turn the tables on his traitorous party members–with the help of a special skill and sexy new allies!**

    A kid named Light is the only human member of the adventuring party Legion of Races,
    but humans are by far the weakest race in his world. When his comrades abandon him to
    the lowest levels of a dungeon, Light resorts to the gift of Infinite Gacha to create
    a harem of Lvl 9999 allies! With his powerful and beautiful new friends by his side,
    can Light escape the dungeon and exact vengeance upon the Legion of Races…and the entire world?
