synopsis: |
    Shizuku is a shy girl who hardly talks to other people. Instead, she loses herself in creative writing,
    crafting a novel that she never plans to show anyone. But when Kaori–Shizuku’s cute, popular classmate–gets
    her hands on Shizuku’s manuscript, everything changes. Kaori is a huge fan, and suggests that Shizuku
    can get inspiration for her writing if the two of them start dating! Can these very different young
    ladies create their own love story together?
