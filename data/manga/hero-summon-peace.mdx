synopsis: |
    **An isekai fantasy that’s more about making friends than making war!**

    Miyama Kaito is no hero. He’s just a normal university student who gets caught up in a
    hero summons with an actual Hero. But even “Hero” is just a ceremonial role these days,
    ever since the Demon Lord was killed centuries ago. In a world where demons are chill,
    nobles are no longer corrupt, wars are a distant memory and there are no more epic quests to complete,
    what’s a regular guy to do? Why, build a harem, of course!
