synopsis: |
    **Opposites attract in this new high school yuri manga!**

    Fujishiro Nanaki is super cute, super popular, and
    super annoyed with anyone as plain as her classmate Kurokawa Kanade.
    When Nanaki finds out her boyfriend’s cheating on her, however,
    her life makes a complete 180—as does her relationship with Kanade.
    This all-new yuri manga series explores the budding romance between
    the cool girl in school and the “plain” girl she once brushed off!
