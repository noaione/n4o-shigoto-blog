                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: That was IOSYS' Touhou Arrangement, Captain...<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Um.. Captain Marine's Assanchor.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Yeah, so today I thought I'd sing a lot of Touhou stuff so I had a lot
                prepared...<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ah, sorry guys. Wait a sec.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Today it seems like the noise from outside is kinda loud.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Wait right there. I'm going to mute the mic for a second.<br />
                <br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: This is weird. Suddenly today so many trucks are passing. The sounds'
                going to be picked up. What to do...<br />
                <br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I'm back! Sorry for the wait.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: For some reason, a lot of trucks are passing outside today.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Well, I'm probably not going to get hit by one and get reborn into
                another world, like a light novel.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Okay, right. So the next song is... I guess I'll sing this...<br />

                <br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Oh yeah.. That's right.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: At today's song event I sang Assanchor, then when I looked outside,
                suddenly a truck crashed into my place!<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: There was a huge impact, and when I woke up, I was.. here.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Waaah! They're just leaves...<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I can't stand it here. It's scary...<br />

                <b>???</b>: I was in a bad mood, and was hoping a lost human might show up to lift my spirits.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh? What the hell are you? A deviant?<br />
                <b>???</b>: I'm not a rabbit of much renown, but I'm in charge of these parts.<br />

                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: That's the only explanation...<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Udonge and Tewi, the stage 5 bosses from "Imperishable Night".<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: What does "reborn in another world" mean?<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You don't even know what it means!?<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: In other words, from my world, I...<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Um... got transported to Gensokyo? Well, it's not like I understand it
                either.<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Ah. Happens all the time.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: No, it doesn't! Not in my world, anyway!<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: No... Actually, things drift into Gensokyo from other worlds all the
                time.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: For real?<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Still, it's not that common for humans to show up.<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: You must've been worried.<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: As long as I'm here, you're safe.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Thank you!<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You're not just there for fan service! I like you for you!<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Hold on. I found her first. Isn't this girl mine to look after?<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Enough of that. Don't act like some feral youkai.<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Don't order me around!<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: We're enemies, after all.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh? Enemies?<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Are you still going on about that? Honestly...<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: I thought the two of you were kind of a double-act, but...<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You don't get along?<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: - I don't know about that, but...<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: - She's the worst!<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Could you not both speak at once?<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: So, to summarise...<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: I received a lot of good carrots, so I thought I'd make her something
                nice.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: So you made baked sweats with carrot in them.<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Can you believe her?<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Putting precious carrots in something like that.<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: I heard they're popular with the humans in the village, and so I made
                some for her.<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: And this is her attitude?<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You mean like carrot cake? That's normal.<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Give me a break. I was so hungry I thought I'd starve, and she puts
                carrots, precious carrots, into cakes.<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: It's carrot desecration!<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: So when I asked about you not getting along, <i>that</i> was the
                reason?<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: - What's that about? How cute!<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: - How long do you thing we've been rabbits?<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: You don't have to get so mad about it. Complaining from dawn...<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Finally storming out of Eientei...<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Hahahaha! How childish!<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Don't call me childish! I'm older than you!<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: But I apologized, didn't I?<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: And I said I wouldn't make them anymore...<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: I was just so hurt, and so hungry. Starving...<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Even so, Udonge gave an honest apology.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: "Honestly"... Oh yeah! The start of "Happy Rabbits"!<br />
                <br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: In the world I came from there's a song about your friendship, even
                through your quarrels and misbehavior.<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>, <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Friends? Us?<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Don't give me that look.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: It's a lovely duet, you know. Though one vocalist's an old guy.<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Which one's the old man?<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh? Which one was it...?<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: I have no idea...<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Judging by the lyrics...<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: It's probably you.<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Me!?<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: They know you so well.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: But anyway...<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: You're such a cute pair, so instead of fighting, let's see you get
                along.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: It'll help move things along.<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Hey, why don't you say something?<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Hmph, this is bumming me out.<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: My anger's gone and vanished.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: That's perfect. Good girl!<br />
                <br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Enough. I'll overlook today, so hurry along back home.<br />
                <b class="sp-tewi">Tewi</b>: Don't waste this good fortune.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh? You're leaving? Wait!<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: That's just like her.<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Now, at at time like this...<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Huh? What is it?<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Ah, there's one. Here!<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: This is... a four-leafed clover!<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: No, five, six, even more? Huh?<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: Her ability is to confer good luck to humans.<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: If you have this, good things will happen to you.<br />
                <b class="sp-udonge">Udonge</b>: First off, I'll take you to safety of the Human Village.<br />
                <b class="sp-marine">Marine</b>: Ah, I'm so glad. Thank you! I'm counting on you!<br />
