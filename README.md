# N4O Release Blog
Or "Shigoto" blog.

This blog contains most of my old and new release that I do sometimes.

This blog was written originally in Jekyll, but now written in NextJS/React.

### Manga stuff
I didn't get request directly to my site, but all of my links are now removed from Google.

I decide to just remove it from my site, don't really want to nuke my whole site because of that.

The funniest part is probably the claimer is d.b.a-ing for wrong publisher for other publisher works that is not relevant at all.
Guessing they just want everything to be removed, even if it is not theirs.
